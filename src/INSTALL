This is pretty simple as far as source installations go:

Step 0: If you're upgrading, read the ChangeLog!  I try not to break things,
        but occasionally configuration options or defaults can change.

Step 1: Run the "configure" script.

Step 2: Compile xferstats.  A simple "make" should be all it takes.

Step 3: If you desire, run "make install".

Step 4: Read the man page.

Step 5: Customize your xferstats.cfg to change default values.

New and old versions are available at ftp://off.net/pub/xferstats as
well as http://xferstats.off.net.  Feedback is welcome at the address
below.
